    "### Part 2: Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for a quick introduction to Bayes' Theorem, check out the Bayes' Theorem Lecture in the statistics appendix portion of this course, in order ot fully understand Naive Bayes, you'll need a complete understanding of the Bayes' Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Introduction to Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is probably one of the practical machine learning algorithms. Despite its name, it is actually performs very well considering its classification performance. It proves to be quite robust to irrelevant features, which it  ignores. It learns and predicts very fast and it does not require lots of storage. So, why is it then called naive?\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive was added to the account for one assumption that is required for Bayes to work optimally: all features must be independent of each other. In reality, this is usually not the case, however, it still returns very good accuracy in practice even when the independent assumption does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously document classification and spam filtering. We will be working with the Iris Flower data set in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Naive Bayes Classifier Mathematics Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. Given a class variable y and a dependent feature vector x<sub>1</sub> through x<sub>n</sub>, Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y \\mid x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{P(y) P(x_1, \\dots x_n \\mid y)}\n",
    "                                 {P(x_1, \\dots, x_n)}$$\n",
    "                                 \n",
    "Using the naive independence assumption that\n",
    "$$P(x_i | y, x_1, \\dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \\dots, x_n) = P(x_i | y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all i, this relationship is simplified to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y \\mid x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{P(y) \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \\mid y)}\n",
    "                                 {P(x_1, \\dots, x_n)}$$\n",
    "                               \n",
    "We now have a relationship between the target and the features using Bayes Theorem along with a Naive Assumption that all features are independent."

    "### Part 5: Constructing a classifier from the probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have derived the independent feature model, the Naive Bayes probability model. The Naive Bayes classifier combines this model with a *decision rule*, this decision rule will decide which hypothesis is most probable, in our example case this will be which class of flower is most probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking the hypothesis that is most probable  is known as the maximum a posteriori or MAP decision rule. The corresponding classifier, a Bayes classifier, is the function that assigns a class label to y as follows:"

    "Since P(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>) is constant given the input, we can use the following classification rule:\n",

    "### Part 6: Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. Go back to the normal distribution lecture to review the formulas for the Gaussian/Normal Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example of using the Gaussian Distribution, suppose the training data contain a continuous attribute, x. We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of x in each class. Let  μ<sub>c</sub> be the mean of the values in x associated with class c, and let  σ<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub> be the variance of the values in x associated with class c. Then, the probability distribution of some value given a class, p(x=v|c), can be computed by plugging v into the equation for a Normal distribution parameterized by μ<sub>c</sub> and  σ<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub>. That is:\n",
    "\n",
